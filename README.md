# PixelPlace

## Introduction

Try it out here: [hak-night.vercel.app](https://hak-night.vercel.app/)
PixelPlace is a collaborative drawing board where users can draw on a canvas and see the changes made by other users in realtime. The data is synced in realtime with Appwrite's database.
This is heavily inspired by the famous r/place experiment by Reddit.
